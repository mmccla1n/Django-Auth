                            - Django documentation states the following, regarding passwords:
                                password Required. A hash of, and metadata about, the password. (Django doesn’t store the raw password.) 
                                Raw passwords can be arbitrarily long and can contain any character. The metadata in this field may mark 
                                the password as unusable.

                            - The username and password were created using DRF HTML form. IT did not hash the password 
                                - will need to use set_password() to make it become hashable
                                - reviewing Manager Methods..create_user, link https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/ref/contrib/auth/
                                    - create_user, creates and saves a user, so the password will need to be hashed before creating
                                - reviewing set_password() documentation
                                    Sets the user’s password to the given raw string, taking care of the password hashing. Doesn’t save the User object.
                                - Found doucmentation reagrding this matter, yet the serializer has fields set to '__all__'..

                                - Researching..How to hash password in Django Rest framework
                                    Django Rest Framework doesn't handle password hashing directly, but it leverages Django's built-in authentication system, which does. Here's how you can hash a password in Django Rest Framework:
                                    1. Use Django's make_password function:
                                    Python

                                    from django.contrib.auth.hashers import make_password

                                    password = "my_secret_password"
                                    hashed_password = make_password(password)
                                    2. Use the set_password method on a user object:
                                    This is the recommended method when working with Django's built-in user model.
                                    Python

                                    from django.contrib.auth.models import User

                                    user = User.objects.create(username="myuser")
                                    user.set_password("my_secret_password")
                                    user.save()

                            - For now going with option 2, also DRF documentation for changing passwords has the following(https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/topics/auth/default/)
                                You can also change a password programmatically, using set_password():

                                >>> from django.contrib.auth.models import User
                                >>> u = User.objects.get(username="john")
                                >>> u.set_password("new password")
                                >>> u.save()

                    - 1st observation. accounts app is not included in the list of INSTALLED_APPS..will remove from my code

                - Reviewing the following link https://medium.com/@lakshminp/drf-object-creation-methods-60476bb9783e
                - Root cause of failure of getting a token, was not using DRF method 'perform_create'.
                    - I named the method 'create_user'.
                    - After naming to 'perform_create', am able to get a token
